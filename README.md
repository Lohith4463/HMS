### Email Service Integration
- **EmailJS**: Client-side email sending capability
- **Template System**: Structured email notifications
- **Delivery Tracking**: Monitor email delivery status

## System Architecture

### Complaint Lifecycle
1. **Submission**: Patient scans QR code → Selects category → Records complaint
2. **Initial Notification**: Email sent to hospital administrator
3. **Monitoring**: System tracks response time against escalation thresholds
4. **Escalation**: Automatic escalation to superintendent if no response
5. **Resolution**: Status updates and feedback collection

### Escalation Logic
```typescript
// Business hours: 9 AM - 9 PM = 12 hours escalation
// After hours: 9 PM - 9 AM = 12-24 hours escalation

if (submissionTime >= 9:00 && submissionTime < 21:00) {
  escalationTime = submissionTime + 12 hours;
} else {
  escalationTime = submissionTime + 24 hours;
}
```

### Data Flow
```
Patient → QR Scan → Complaint Form → Context State → Email Service
                                        ↓
Admin Dashboard ← Status Updates ← Escalation Service ← Time Monitor
```
